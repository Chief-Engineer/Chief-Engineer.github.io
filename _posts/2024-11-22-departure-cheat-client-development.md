The departure post said the reason that work stopped on the open source cheat client was because there was now a paid cheat client. Development has stopped on the open source client, and there is currently a paid cheat client, but the developer of the open source cheat client contacted me saying that they are not involved in the development of the paid client, and that they have not interacted with the community since stopping work on their client.

I haven't made any attempt to verify their lack of involvement/interaction with the community, I just figured I'd add this on to the update posts I'm making.
